## Major Enhancements
- For Reddit posts that link directly to a 3rd party asset (image or URL) rather than a reddit discussion, provide the link to BOTH the reddit thread AND the item.
- Add the capability to optionally filter a subreddit by a configurable minimum score threshhold.
- Add the capability to optionally filter a subreddit by lists of reddit flair to exclude

## Long term
